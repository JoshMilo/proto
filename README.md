# ProtoApp
A personal boilerplate for prototyping app ideas, life choices, and cults.

## Step 1
- Get an idea

## Step 2
- Install webpack and TypeScript globally `npm install -g typescript webpack` 
- Run `npm link typescript` why? So you don't have to download a local copy.
- Install yarn [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) why yarn? Because it's soft and yarny.
- Run `yarn` command.
